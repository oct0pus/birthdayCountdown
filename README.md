# birthdayCountdown
Simple Javascript countdown for multiple occasions (Birthday, New Years, Anniversary)
NOTE: UI/UX is not great, the user has to put the date in as numbers. 

This is not finished, as I plan on adding different effects depending on occasion. Right now, just the screen turns pink if it's a birthday.
